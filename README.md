# Jira Learning – QA Practice (Password Reset Feature)

## About This Repository

This repository contains my **hands‑on practice and documentation of Jira (Atlassian)** from a Software Testing / Manual QA perspective.
Instead of only studying theory, I simulated a real company workflow by creating a sample project and managing requirements, tasks, and defects inside Jira.

I built a small mock project based on a common real‑world feature used in almost every application:

> **Password Reset (Authentication Module)**

The goal was to understand how a tester actually works inside a company’s Jira board — not just what Jira is.

---

## Project Scenario (Realistic Simulation)

**Project Name:** Software Development
**Module:** Authentication
**Epic:** Password Reset Feature

I practiced managing the full workflow of a feature from requirement creation to bug reporting.

### Real‑World Mapping

| Jira Concept | Meaning in Real Project | My Example                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Epic         | Large feature           | Password Reset Feature                 |
| Story        | User requirement        | User wants to reset password           |
| Task         | Implementation work     | UI design, API creation, email setup   |
| Sub‑task     | Small step              | Token generation, validation, template |
| Bug          | Defect found            | Multiple reset emails issue            |

## What I Practiced in Jira

### 1. Project Creation

* Created a **Team‑Managed Kanban Project**
* Generated project key: `SD`
* Enabled backlog and epic panel
* Configured work types (Story, Task, Bug)

### 2. Requirement Creation

Created Epic:

> **Epic 1: Password Reset Feature**

Created Story:

> *As a registered user, I want to reset my password so I can regain access to my account.*

Linked story to the epic and managed it through the board workflow.

---

### 3. Task Management

Created implementation tasks such as:

* UI Design for password reset page
* Backend API creation
* Email notification setup

Moved tasks through workflow columns:
`To Do → In Progress → Done`

---

### 4. Sub‑tasks

Created child tasks under a parent task, for example:

* Create wireframe
* Input validation
* Token generation
* Email template creation

This helped understand how real teams break down work into smaller deliverables.

---

### 5. Bug Reporting (QA Activity)

I simulated a real defect reported by users:

**Bug:** Users receiving multiple password reset emails

In the bug report I practiced adding:

* Summary
* Description
* Steps to reproduce
* Expected result
* Actual result

This is the core daily work of a Manual QA tester.

---

### 6. Workflow Management

Customized the workflow by adding a new status:

`Deployed`

Learned how work progresses in a real team pipeline and how testers verify after developer fixes.

---

### 7. Tracking & Monitoring

Explored different Jira views:

* Backlog view
* Board view
* Timeline view
* Calendar view
* List view

Learned how managers and testers track project progress visually.

---

### 8. Releases & Time Tracking

Practiced:

* Creating software release versions
* Logging work hours using **Log Work** feature

This reflects how companies monitor developer and tester effort during sprints.

---

## Bug Lifecycle (Practiced)

`New → Assigned → In Progress → Fixed → Retest → Closed / Reopen`

I understood the tester’s responsibility after a developer marks a bug as fixed (retesting and validation).

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* Jira Navigation
* Agile Workflow Understanding
* Requirement Handling
* Bug Reporting
* Issue Linking
* Workflow Status Handling
* Basic Release Management

---

## Why This Project Matters

Most software companies use Jira as their primary defect tracking and work management tool.
This repository shows that I can:

* Work inside a real Jira board
* Communicate with developers using industry terminology
* Report professional bugs
* Understand Agile team workflow

This is intended as a **portfolio project for entry‑level Manual QA / Software Testing roles**.

---

## Planned Improvements

* Add screenshots of Jira board
* Add sample bug report template
* Link with OpenCart testing project
* Add RTM mapping (Requirement → Test Case → Bug)
